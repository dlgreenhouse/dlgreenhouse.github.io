        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>After 15 years in the nutrition industry, I have decided to change careers! I recently became interested in software development while working with a technology company to implement new nutrition software in our department. I find it fascinating to see coding come to life and how it can streamline processes in several different fields. </p>
